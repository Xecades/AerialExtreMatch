    """Collate function that allows to replace corrupted examples in the
    dataloader. It expect that the dataloader returns 'None' when that occurs.
    The 'None's in the batch are replaced with another examples sampled randomly.

    Args:
        batch (torch.Tensor): batch from the DataLoader.
        dataset (torch.utils.data.Dataset): dataset which the DataLoader is loading.
            Specify it with functools.partial and pass the resulting partial function that only
            requires 'batch' argument to DataLoader's 'collate_fn' option.

    Returns:
        torch.Tensor: batch with new examples instead of corrupted ones.
